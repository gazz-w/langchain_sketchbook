# Simple LLM Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of an LLM (Language Learning Model) in Langchain. The purpose of this project is to provide a basic understanding of the LLM concept and its syntax.


## Usage

To use this simple LLM implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gazz-w/langchain_sketchbook
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd simple_llm_implementation
    ```

3. Create a .env file and add your API KEY.
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_here"
    ```

4. Run the LLM program:
    ```
    python llm.py
    ```

5. Follow the instructions provided by the program to interact with the LLM.

That's it! You now have a basic understanding of the LLM implementation in Langchain.
