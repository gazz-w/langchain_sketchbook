# Output Parsers in Langchain Framework

The Langchain framework provides a powerful set of output parsers that allow you to process and manipulate data generated by various language processing tasks. These parsers are designed to be flexible, efficient, and easy to use.

## Installation

To use the output parsers in the Langchain framework, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the Langchain framework installed. If not, refer to the [Langchain documentation](https://langchain-docs.com) for installation instructions.

2. Import the necessary modules in your code:

```python
import langchain.output_parsers as parsers
```

3. You're ready to start using the output parsers!

## Usage

The Langchain output parsers provide a variety of functions and methods to parse and manipulate data. Here are some common use cases:

### Parsing JSON

```python
data = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}'
parsed_data = parsers.parse_json(data)
print(parsed_data)
```

### Extracting Text

```python
html_content = '<html><body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>'
extracted_text = parsers.extract_text(html_content)
print(extracted_text)
```

### Cleaning Text

```python
dirty_text = 'This is some dirty text with unwanted characters!@#$'
clean_text = parsers.clean_text(dirty_text)
print(clean_text)
```
